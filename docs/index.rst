FALL - Framework for Adaptive Life-Long Learning
================================================

FALL is designed to enable both practitioners and researchers to develop and implement machine learning systems for streaming data, in the presence of changing conditions.
FALL is a framework for building adaptive learning systems capable of incrementally learning from streaming data, and adapting to changing conditions.
FALL is modular, based around a standard architecture for adaptive learning. This enables existing methods to be easily recreated, as well as novel methods to be easily implemented without re-implementing standard components.
